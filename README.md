# Maps_with_R

## If the libraries like tidyverse, sf and osmdata is not installed, installation of those are needed.
## The R code mainly generates the maps but the final touches were given using Photoshop.
## You can generated maps of any city just by changing the name of the city in the code and then need to change the coordinates.
